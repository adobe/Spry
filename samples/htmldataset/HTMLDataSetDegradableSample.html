<h3>HTMLDataSet sample that gracefully degrades (shows its data even with javascript disabled in browser).</h3>
<p>This sample shows how to use HTMLDataSet to get Spry-related functionality (master-detail display, sorting, hover on items, row selected) and still be able to 
  display the full data when javascript is disabled in the browser.</p>
<hr />
<p> In this sample the HTMLDataSet is loading its data from the table with the ID &quot;productsTable&quot; located in this file. <br/>
  When the page is loading, the HTMLDataSet hides the table source element and a spry:region / spry:detailregion is used to display the data in master-detail layout. <br/>
  If you turn off the javascript in the browser and refresh, only the source table will be visible so the data is still being displayed on the page.<br/>
